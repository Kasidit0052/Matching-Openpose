# Matching-Openpose
This is an Implementation of pose matching algorithm using output from Openpose
# Pose Estimation Framework
We decided to based our project on Openpose API due to it exceptional accuracy. For more information about Openpose, please refer to [Openpose GitHub](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose)
# Contents
You can find an Intuitive explaination of Openpose API and Pose Matching Algorithm from [the Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Kasidit0052/MatchingOpenpose/blob/main/OpenPose.ipynb)
